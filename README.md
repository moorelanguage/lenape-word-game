# Word guessing game 
This repo will contain a fork of Word Tuah, a brain rot version of Wordle made by The-CodingSloth. 
Only instead of Word Tuah it would be a serious Lenape Language word guessing game with a definition. 
Development started on 2025-12-07, idea on 2025-12-06. 2025-12-08 at 1:56 AM is when this fork went public.

```bash
npm run build
```

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```


## Known Issues

The logo placeholder doesn't render in github webapp. 

### Development Roadmap
This Roadmap is in order of "sooner -> later" 

- fix logo placeholder render 
- add more words 
- add animation to make the letters flip like a card! Make it feel like a card game! 
- make a toggle between Lenape Dialects (only has Southern Unami Dialect right now)
- speaking of Southern Unami, creating an option to toggle with or without diacritics depending on what the user wants.

[![About Me](https://img.shields.io/badge/About_Me-333333)](https://moorelanguage.github.io/moorelanguage/)    
TLDR: I am a Lenape Language Learner and Enthusaist, I love exploring languages and building tools to support language learning and tools that are in Lenape. I usually use Python but sometimes I dabble in TypeScript for my unreleased Obsidian plugins and Javascript for a sodoku program I have. 
I have some online projects:
- [![Ultimate Lenape Language List](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ultimate_Lenape_Language_List-D50205)](https://https://github.com/moorelanguage/Ultimate-Lenape) a list that aims to list everything related to the Lenape Language in one github repo.
- [![Tëmp Kaxkëni](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tëmp_Kaxkëni-B22222?)](https://github.com/moorelanguage/Temp-Kaxkeni) which is a reskin of Brainfuck in the Lenape Language. 
- [![CLI Lenape Assistant](https://img.shields.io/badge/CLI_Lenape_Assistant-333333?logo=terminal&logoColor=fff)](https://github.com/moorelanguage/CLI-Lenape-Assistant) a command line assistant to help you do various tasks from the command line in English and Lenape.

This is a fork of a program by The-CodingSloth. Wanishi ta!
