This changelog summarizes changes I've made. I'm writing this by hand.   

## 2025-12-07 
Cloned repo, removed flashbang and audio, removed "Word Tuah" name from this fork and replaced it with this name, added word lists. There is one template entry copy and pasted many times so dog is more likely to show up than other words for now LOL. Made sure license was correct, messed around with gameboard.tsx to change some aesthetic stuff like some heights and the word animations. Edited readme of course and edited some stuff with the layout and links and stuff.

Unsure how I wanted to do this Lenape word game, before I found the repo this fork is from.
