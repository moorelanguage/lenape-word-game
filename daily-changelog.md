This changelog summarizes changes I've made. I'm writing this by hand.   

## 2025-12-08
Fixed bugs, worked on making an electron app. I fixed bugs that interfered with making the electron app. Also worked on making an android apk version with Capacitor, which revealed more bugs to fix. Worked on getting github pages hosting up. I focused on github pages after I had to attend to another duty, deciding to leave electron and andriod apk for later and putting it andriod and electron in my gitignore. I also fixed a major issue in keyboard.tsx. 

## 2025-12-07 
Cloned repo, removed flashbang and audio, removed "Word Tuah" name from this fork and replaced it with this name, added word lists. There is one template entry copy and pasted many times so dog is more likely to show up than other words for now LOL. Made sure license was correct, messed around with gameboard.tsx to change some aesthetic stuff like some heights and the word animations. Edited readme of course and edited some stuff with the layout and links and stuff.

Unsure how I wanted to do this Lenape word game, before I found the repo this fork is from.
